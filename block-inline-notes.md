# Block vs Inline:
- most elements are default block elements, blocks appear stacked on each other, each new element is on a new line
- inline elements begin on the same line, <a> is an inline element
    - **you generally dont want to add padding and margin on inline elements**
- inline-block behave like inline elements but with block-style padding and margin, **You will probably use flexbox to line up a bunch of boxes**

## Divs and spans:
- these dont have meaning to their context, unlike paragraph elements
